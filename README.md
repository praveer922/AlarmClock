# AlarmClock

I have a hard time waking up, so I wrote a simple Alarm Clock C++ desktop GUI with the Nana library: https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana.

The alarm gradually increases in volume till it's at a near deafening volume (my desktop is hooked up to speakers in my room).
This should force me to get out of my bed and make it to my desk to turn it off.
